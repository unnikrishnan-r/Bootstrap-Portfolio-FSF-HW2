                        Computers always fascinated me as a kid, and after having spent more than a decade in the world
                        of
                        custom softwares I still feel like a boy standing at the seashore picking pebbles. That speaks
                        volumes
                        about the endless possibility
                        technology and specifically software opens up for the betterment of daily life for each one of
                        us.
                        That
                        is what motivated me to set out in exploration to the world of web development!!!

                        My career so far has revolved around the famous Mainframes! Right out of college, my first job
                        was
                        as a
                        COBOL/DB2 developer and there has been no looking back since.
                        In 11 years, I have built numerous Mainframe based applications using COBOL and CICS, with DB2
                        or
                        IMS on
                        the backend.
                        When you buy groceries, it is very likely that you are invoking a piece of code that has my name
                        on
                        it,
                        because my clients were primarily the household names of retail industry.
                        I have also worked with integration tools like TIBCO, and have my fair share of exposure to
                        messaging
                        frameworks, webservices, REST APIs etc.

                        Outside of work, I am a sports enthusiast (just to watch ;)) and a foodie. I love going on road
                        trips,
                        and even after 2 toddlers I have not given that up.
